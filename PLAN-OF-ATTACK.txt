Goal: automatically extract the time-spans for all codings in a certain tier of an ELAN output, then makes a video clip for each of those.

ELAN file parsing
1. (to do) Script can get entry for each coding in a hard-coded tier.
2. (to do) Can pull out just the start and end times for each coding.
3. (to do) The tier name can now be user-specified.

Video clipping stuff
4. (to do) Can make a clip of a video from the command line.
5. (to do) A script can insert arbitrary, hard-coded times into this command.
6. (to do) A script can do this repeatedly from a hard-coded list of times and auto-generated output file names.

Bringing all the parts together
7. (to do) Convert start and end times from ELAN to format for commanding the video clipping script.
8. (to do) It works!
